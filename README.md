## Single-Page Final Application using MVC design

Utilized MVC design in jQuery to implement dynamic loading into one single div on the index.html.

This project allowed me to practice using jQuery and Sass in a MVC design.

Content loads dynamically and all content is adaptive and responsive using media queries and percentages.
