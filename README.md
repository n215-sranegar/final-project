## Single-Page Final Application using MVC design

- Utilized MVC design in jQuery to implement dynamic loading into one single div on the index.html.

- This project allowed me to practice using jQuery and Sass using an MVC design.

- Content loads dynamically and all content is adaptive and responsive using media queries and percentages.

- Utilized functions to change the color of my navigation links and nav-logo from the home-page content to all other pages.
